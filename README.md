## SQL Queries Used

Examples:

```sql
-- Show all customer records
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Count total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- Transactions from Chennai market (Mark001)
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

-- Distinct products sold in Chennai
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

-- Transactions using USD currency
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency='USD';

-- Total revenue for 2020
SELECT SUM(t.sales_amount)
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN date d ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year = 2020 AND (t.currency='INR' OR t.currency='USD');
```
